What is super keyword:
    super keyword in java is used to refer to the parent class object.
Why should we learn super keyword.
    1) if we have same name variable or method in the super/parent/base class then we
    can use the super keyword to refer to parent class variable or method because by
    default, java prefers the variables of child class. We can also call the supper class
    constructor with the help of super with parenthesis super();
How to use super keyword:
    1) We can use super. method name or field name to call the method or to access the
    field of super class.
    2) use the super with parenthesis to call the super class constructor.

Rules:
    1) we can only access the immediate parent class constructor or field or method
    with the help of super keyword.
    2) we can only use super() inside a constructor.
    3) if we have a user created constructor in the parent class, we must have a matching parameter
    constructor inside the child classes as well.
    4) If we have multiple constructors inside the parent, as soon as one is matched, we are good to go.
    we don't need to match each and every constructor from the parent class.
    5) super() should be the first line inside a constructor.

What is MethodOverloading:
    When same name method exists in a class but with different number of parameters or
    different type of parameters or different sequence of parameters, it is called
    methodOverloading.
