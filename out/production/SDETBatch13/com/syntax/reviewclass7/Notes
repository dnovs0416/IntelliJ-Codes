Types of variables in java:
    We have three types of variables 1)local 2)instance 3)static.
Local variables:
    Are the variables that we declared inside a block of code
    upSide:They occupy the memory for shortest period of time
    downSide: They can't be accessed outside that block in which they are declared.
Instance variable:
    Are the variables that are declared inside a class but outside of a block of code
    upSide: Can be accessed in all the methods of class. They can have different values for each
    instance of that class
