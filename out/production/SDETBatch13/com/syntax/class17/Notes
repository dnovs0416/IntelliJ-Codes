Access Modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywords in java that help us control the access of
    classes, variables, methods and other code of block. There are 4 access levels in java -
    private, default (it is not a keyword), protected, public. We have 3 keywords that
    define these access levels - 1) private 2) protected 3) public.
Private:
    When we use the private keyword with a method or field, it is only accessible inside that class.
    It is the most restricted access modifier.
Default(it is not a keyword):
    When we don't use any access modifier keyword with a field or a method then default access is applied
    by java which means we can access this variable or method inside the same class as well as all the other
    classes which exists inside the same package.
Protected:
    When we have protected access modifier, we can access that method or variable inside the same class+ inside
    the other classes which are inside the same package + inside the classes which are in different packages
    as well but they must have extends relationship with the original class.
Public:
    When we use the public access modifier, we can use that field or method anywhere inside
    the same project.
